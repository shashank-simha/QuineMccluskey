# QuineMccluskey
Quine Mccluskey algorithm implementation in python

Quine Mccluskey algorithm used to 
obtain minimal boolean expression

Steps:
1. import the class QM from QM.py
   i.e; from QM import QM
2. declare an object of the class QM
   q=QM()
3. call solve() method
   q.solve()
   this prints the simplified 
expression
4. different methods available in class 
QM
   q.printTables()  prints Prime 
Implicant and Essential Prime
Implicant selection tables
   q.printImplicants() prints Prime
Implicants and Essential Prime
Implicants
   q.solution() prints simplified 
expression
